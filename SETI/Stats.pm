=head1 NAME

SETI::Stats - gather local and remote SETI@home stats and manipulate them

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SETI::Stats;

  $s = new SETI::Stats ( rsh => "/semi-free/bin/ssh -l ernie",
                         host => "bert",
                         dir => "/seti" );
  $s->visit;
  print $s->user_info("email_addr");
  print $s->bar . "\n";

  $t = new SETI::Stats ( dir => "/martin/seti", save => "p" );
  while (1) {
    $t->visit;
    print $t->dump . "\n\n";
    sleep(60);
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl class provides an object oriented API which lets you gather
SETI@home stats from one or more machines and gives you a programmatic
way of getting access to them.  It can cope with multiple SETI@home
clients which share a directory hierarchy accessible to the machine it
is run on, clients which each have their own private filespace (using
I<rsh>, I<ssh> or equivalent) and even works for boxes running Windows NT.
   
SETI::Stats borrows from Jan Rocho's B<perlseti.pl>, but differs in
several ways - this is a module devoted to stats gathering rather than
a general purpose control program, it can be used to monitor remote
machines without even requiring Perl to be installed on them, and 
it provides a generic framework for access to (both local and remote)
SETI@home client stats.  It could also be extended to cover stats
gathering from the SETI@home WWW server, though this may be better done
in a separate module to avoid code bloat.

=head1 METHODS

Each B<SETI::Stats> object supports the following methods:

=over 4

=item new

Create a new B<SETI::Stats> object.  The following parameters are
supported:

=over 4

=item dir

This is the (local or remote) directory where B<SETI::Stats> will look
for the SETI@home client's stats files.  It defaults to I</home/seti>.

=item host

When gathering stats remotely, this is the name of the host to contact.
It will also be used as part of the name of B<SETI::Stats>' own state
file - see below for more info on this.

=item rsh

The command (I<rsh> or equivalent) which will be used to contact the
remote host when gathering stats over the Internet.  If you need to
specify a user name or other parameters, you can add them here, e.g.

  rsh => "/semi-free/bin/ssh -l ernie"

This defaults to I<ssh>.

=item save

The filename (absolute or relative) prefix of the local file to store
B<SETI::Stats>' state info in.  This defaults to I<perlseti_data>.  
See below for more information on state file naming.

=item source

The radio telescope data source for the SETI@home client.  By default
this is set to the I<Arecibo Radio Observatory>, which is currently the
only source of data for the SETI@home experiment.

=back

Note that none of these parameters is mandatory.  In particular, you
don't have to store state info between polling clients - unless you
want to use the B<dump> method.  The B<visit> method will store it for
you, however!

=item poll

This method polls the SETI@home client being monitored by this
B<SETI::Stats> object for a given section of its stats.  It takes the
following parameters:

=over 4

=item checkpoint

This indicates that the B<poll> invocation is of the local checkpoint
file maintained by B<SETI::Stats> rather than a (possibly remote) state
file maintained by the SETI@home client itself.  It's set automatically
by the B<visit> method when updating the local checkpoint file.

=item section

This is the section name to poll for, corresponding to the file
I<section>.txt in the SETI@home working directory on the client machine.

=back

This method is normally used internally by the B<visit> method.

=item populate

This method populates the internal data structures used by B<SETI::Stats>
for this section of the stats.  It takes the following parameters:

=over 4

=item results

An array of results, in the format I<attribute>=I<value>, with one
attribute/value pair per entry - e.g. I<prog=0.487688>

=item section

The section name of the stats to populate, e.g. I<work_unit>.

=back

This method is normally used internally by the B<visit> method.

=item checkpoint

This method saves B<SETI::Stats>' current state info to a file on
the local machine (even when monitoring a remote one).  The file name
is determined by the values of the B<dir> and B<save> parameters when
the object was created, e.g. with a B<dir> of I</seti> and a B<save>
of I<perlseti_state>, the file created would be I</seti/perlseti_state.txt>
when the local host was being monitored.

In the case of a remote client being monitored, the host name is appended
to B<dir> and B<save>, prefixed by an underscore, e.g. for the client
machine I<bert>, the file would be I</seti/perlseti_state_bert.txt>.
Note that the value of B<save> no longer needs to contain the string
I<perlseti> (as was the case in B<SETI::Stats> 1.00 and 1.01) for this
feature to work properly.

You don't have to checkpoint, but be aware that this info is used by the
B<dump> method.

This method is normally used internally by the B<visit> method.

=item visit

This method is the one you would normally call when polling a given
SETI@home client for its stats.  It in turn calls the B<poll> method
for each of the I<result_header>, I<state>, I<user_info>, I<version>
and I<work_unit> stats files and populates the B<SETI::Stats> object's
internal data structures with the contents of these files.

These are then accessible through the B<result_header>, B<state>,
B<user_info>, B<version> and B<work_unit> methods.

B<visit> also calls the B<checkpoint> and B<poll> methods, which store
B<SETI::Stats>' state information and populates the internal data
structure used by the B<perlseti_data> method.

=back

Access methods:

=over 4

=item bar

Returns a progress bar of '#' characters, representing the percentage
of the work unit which has been analysed so far - on a scale of 0 to
80 characters, where 80 indicates that the work unit is complete.

=item dump

Returns a SETI stats info 'screen' in the style of B<perlseti.pl>,
based on the last polled values for this SET@home client.

=item perlseti_data

The method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<perlseti_data> section of the client's stats.  This section is
unusual in that it is collected by B<SETI::Stats> rather than the
SETI@home client itself.

=item result_header

This method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<result_header> section of the client's stats.

=item state

This method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<state> section of the client's stats.

=item user_info

This method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<user_info> section of the client's stats.

=item version

This method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<version> section of the client's stats.

=item work_unit

This method returns the value of the nominated parameter in the
I<work_unit> section of the client's stats.

=back

Examples of the access methods in use can be found above in the SYNOPSIS
section of this manpage.

=head1 BUGS

This is still fairly new stuff, so probably contains much which is
apocryphal, or just plain wrong :-)

If the object existed already we should probably take care to overwrite
or remove old stats in a section when doing an update, or we could end up
with the situation that some stats are current but others aren't.

Return codes should be documented.

There should be a test module.

Debugging options would be useful!
